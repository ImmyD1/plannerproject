This is my organiser application. At the top of each page is the navigation to all the other pages.

Homepage (homepage.html)
On the homepage is the ability to take notes and save them. It uses a NotesAPI created through js. It saves the notes so that you are able to access them if you leave and come back to the site, they are still available to you. If you double click on the note it gives you the opportunity to delete.

Tasks (task.html)
This is a simple to-do list application which allows you to type in your tasks and add them to an appending list. Once it has been added, you are able to check it which strikesthrough. Selecting the 'x' removes the object from the list. It also saves your tasks in the web browser using LocalStorage.

Calendar (calendar5.html)
This is a calendar application with the ability to access different days and add events to the days. This also uses localstorage to save the events in the days so they are still there when you return to them.

Contacts (contacts.html)
This contacts page utilises C#. I have created a contacts database where the data is stored. Using C# I have created an API where the data is pulled from and into the page. I have created the Edit and Delete buttons but they are currently not functional due to time contraints. It is a mode for future work as well as a button to create new contacts.

Weather (weather.html)
This is a simple weather app I worked on towards the beginning of the course. It uses a weather api and fetches the data depending on the city entered into the search box. Doesn't relate that much to the project but thought I would add it in as it is another complete api app.
